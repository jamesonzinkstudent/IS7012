    <h2>Program:</h2>
    <em><h3>Master of Science in Information Systems</h3></em>
    <h2>Why I am in the program</h2>
    <p>I graduated from Ohio University in 2020, and immediately after began planning my next step in education.
    I knew that I wanted to continue with Information Systems, and I found that University of Cincinnati had a program.
    After this, UC became my first school that I wanted to get into, and I began my plan of getting real life experience
    while also preparing for what I needed to get into UC. It turned out perfectly with UC offering an all online program that 
    starts any semester, and I have been a student in the Masters program since winter semester of 2023.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I am an avid movie watched and go to see them in theaters whenever I can. In highschool I had
            the original version of MoviePass where it was unlimited movies to see in theater for $10 a month.
            Obviously, that was not sustainable but they have brought back the service in different tiered options 
            that can be found <a href="https://www.moviepass.com/">here</a>
        </li>
        <li>I also have been known to enjoy a nice round of golf. See pic below.</li>
